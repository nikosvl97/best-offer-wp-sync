Assets Folder Structure
========================

This plugin follows WordPress best practices with organized asset folders:

assets/
├── css/
│   └── (CSS files would go here for future admin interfaces)
└── js/
    └── (JavaScript files would go here for future admin interfaces)

Note: Current version is CLI-only and doesn't require CSS/JS assets.
Future versions with admin interface will use these folders.
